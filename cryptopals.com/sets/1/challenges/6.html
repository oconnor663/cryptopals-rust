      This challenge isn't conceptually hard, but it involves actual error-prone
      coding. The other challenges in this set are there to bring you up to speed.
      This one is there to <b>qualify</b> you. If you can do this one, you're
      probably just fine up to Set 6.

  It's been base64'd after being encrypted with repeating-key XOR.
</p>
<p>
  Decrypt it.
</p>
<p>
  Here's how:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Let KEYSIZE be the guessed length of the key; try values from 2 to (say) 40.
  </li>
  <li>
    Write a function to compute the edit distance/Hamming distance
    between two strings. <i>The Hamming distance is just the number of
    differing bits.</i> The distance between:
    <pre>this is a test</pre>
    and
    <pre>wokka wokka!!!</pre>
    is
    <b>37.</b>
    <i>Make sure your code agrees before you proceed.</i>
  </li>
  <li>
    For each KEYSIZE, take the <i>first</i> KEYSIZE worth of bytes, and the
    <i>second</i> KEYSIZE worth of bytes, and find the edit distance between
    them. Normalize this result by dividing by KEYSIZE.
  </li>
  <li>
    The KEYSIZE with the smallest normalized edit distance is probably
    the key. You could proceed perhaps with the smallest 2-3 KEYSIZE
    values. Or take 4 KEYSIZE blocks instead of 2 and average the
    distances.
  </li>
  <li>
    Now that you probably know the KEYSIZE: break the ciphertext into
    blocks of KEYSIZE length.
  </li>
  <li>
    Now transpose the blocks: make a block that is the first byte of
    every block, and a block that is the second byte of every block, and
    so on.
  </li>
  <li>
    Solve each block as if it was single-character XOR. You already
    have code to do this.
  </li>
  <li>
    For each block, the single-byte XOR key that produces the best
    looking histogram is the repeating-key XOR key byte for that
    block. Put them together and you have the key.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  This code is going to turn out to be surprisingly useful later on. Breaking repeating-key XOR ("Vigenere") statistically
  is obviously an academic exercise, a "Crypto 101" thing. But more people "know how" to break it than can <i>actually break it</i>,
  and a similar technique breaks something much more important.

      We get more tech support questions for this challenge than any of the other ones. We promise,
      there aren't any blatant errors in this text. In particular: the "wokka wokka!!!" edit distance
      really is 37.
