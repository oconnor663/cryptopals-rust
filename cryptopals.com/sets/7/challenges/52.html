          <h3>Iterated Hash Function Multicollisions</h3>
          <p>
  While we're on the topic of hash functions...
</p>
<p>
  The major feature you want in your hash function is
  collision-resistance. That is, it should be hard to generate
  collisions, and it should be <i>really</i> hard to generate a collision for a
  given hash (<i>aka</i> preimage).
</p>
<p>
  Iterated hash functions have a problem: the effort to generate <i>lots</i> of
  collisions scales sublinearly.
</p>
<p>
  What's an iterated hash function? For all intents and purposes, we're
  talking about the Merkle-Damgard construction. It looks like this:
</p>
<pre>function MD(M, H, C):
  for M[i] in pad(M):
    H := C(M[i], H)
  return H</pre>
<p>
  For message M, initial state H, and compression function C.
</p>
<p>
  This should look really familiar, because SHA-1 and MD4 are both in
  this category. What's cool is you can use this formula to build a
  makeshift hash function out of some spare crypto primitives you have
  lying around (e.g. C = AES-128).
</p>
<p>
  Back on task: the cost of collisions scales sublinearly. What does
  that mean? If it's feasible to find one collision, it's probably
  feasible to find a lot.
</p>
<p>
  How? For a given state H, find two blocks that collide. Now take the
  resulting hash from this collision as your new H and repeat. Recognize
  that with each iteration you can actually double your collisions by
  subbing in either of the two blocks for that slot.
</p>
<p>
  This means that if finding two colliding messages takes 2^(b/2) work
  (where b is the bit-size of the hash function), then finding 2^n
  colliding messages only takes n*2^(b/2) work.
</p>
<p>
  Let's test it. First, build your own MD hash function. We're going to
  be generating a LOT of collisions, so don't knock yourself out. In
  fact, go out of your way to make it bad. Here's one way:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Take a fast block cipher and use it as C.</li>
  <li>
    Make H pretty small. I won't look down on you if it's only 16
    bits. Pick some initial H.
  </li>
  <li>
    H is going to be the input key and the output block from C. That
    means you'll need to pad it on the way in and drop bits on the
    way out.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Now write the function f(n) that will generate 2^n collisions in this
  hash function.
</p>
<p>
  Why does this matter? Well, one reason is that people have tried to
  strengthen hash functions by cascading them together. Here's what I
  mean:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Take hash functions f and g.</li>
  <li>Build h such that h(x) = f(x) || g(x).</li>
</ol>
<p>
  The idea is that if collisions in f cost 2^(b1/2) and collisions in g
  cost 2^(b2/2), collisions in h should come to the princely sum of
  2^((b1+b2)/2).
</p>
<p>
  But now we know that's not true!
</p>
<p>
  Here's the idea:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Pick the "cheaper" hash function. Suppose it's f.</li>
  <li>Generate 2^(b2/2) colliding messages in f.</li>
  <li>There's a good chance your message pool has a collision in g.</li>
  <li>Find it.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  And if it doesn't, keep generating cheap collisions until you find it.
</p>
<p>
  Prove this out by building a more expensive (but not <i>too</i> expensive)
  hash function to pair with the one you just used. Find a pair of
  messages that collide under both functions. Measure the total number
  of calls to the collision function.
