<p>
  Let us Google this for you:
  <a href='http://lmgtfy.com/?q=%22Chosen+ciphertext+attacks+against+protocols+based+on+the+RSA+encryption+standard%22'>
    "Chosen ciphertext attacks against protocols based on the RSA encryption standard"
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  This is Bleichenbacher from CRYPTO '98; I get a bunch of .ps versions
  on the first search page.
</p>
<p>
  Read the paper. It describes a padding oracle attack on
  PKCS#1v1.5. The attack is similar in spirit to the CBC padding oracle
  you built earlier; it's an "adaptive chosen ciphertext attack", which
  means you start with a valid ciphertext and repeatedly corrupt it,
  bouncing the adulterated ciphertexts off the target to learn things
  about the original.
</p>
<p>
  This is a common flaw even in modern cryptosystems that use RSA.
</p>
<p>
  It's also the most fun you can have building a crypto attack. It
  involves 9th grade math, but also has you implementing an algorithm
  that is complex on par with finding a minimum cost spanning tree.
</p>
<p>
  The setup:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Build an oracle function, just like you did in the last exercise, but
    have it check for plaintext[0] == 0 and plaintext[1] == 2.
  </li>
  <li>
    Generate a 256 bit keypair (that is, p and q will each be 128 bit
    primes), [n, e, d].
  </li>
  <li>Plug d and n into your oracle function.</li>
  <li>
    PKCS1.5-pad a short message, like "kick it, CC", and call it
    "m". Encrypt to to get "c".
  </li>
  <li>
    Decrypt "c" using your padding oracle.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  For this challenge, we've used an untenably small RSA modulus (you
  could factor this keypair instantly). That's because this exercise
  targets a specific step in the Bleichenbacher paper --- Step 2c, which
  implements a fast, nearly O(log n) search for the plaintext.
</p>
<p>
  Things you want to keep in mind as you read the paper:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>RSA ciphertexts are just numbers.</li>
  <li>
    RSA is "homomorphic" with respect to multiplication, which means you
    can multiply c * RSA(2) to get a c' that will decrypt to plaintext
    * 2. This is mindbending but easy to see if you play with it in
    code --- try multiplying ciphertexts with the RSA encryptions of
    numbers so you know you grok it.
  </li>
  <li>
    What you need to grok for this challenge is that Bleichenbacher uses
    multiplication on ciphertexts the way the CBC oracle uses
    XORs of random blocks.
  </li>
  <li>
    A PKCS#1v1.5 conformant plaintext, one that starts with 00:02, must be
    a number between 02:00:00...00 and 02:FF:FF..FF --- in other
    words, 2B and 3B-1, where B is the bit size of the modulus
    minus the first 16 bits. When you see 2B and 3B, that's the
    idea the paper is playing with.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  To decrypt "c", you'll need Step 2a from the paper (the search for the
  first "s" that, when encrypted and multiplied with the ciphertext,
  produces a conformant plaintext), Step 2c, the fast O(log n) search,
  and Step 3.
</p>
<p>
  Your Step 3 code is probably not going to need to handle multiple
  ranges.
</p>
<p>
  We recommend you just use the raw math from paper (check, check,
  double check your translation to code) and not spend too much time
  trying to grok how the math works.
